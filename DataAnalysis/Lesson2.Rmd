# Introduction

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All tidyverse packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

This loads several core packages:

- **ggplot2** (data visualization)
- **dplyr** (data manipulation)
- **tidyr** (tidy data formatting)
- **readr** (reading rectangular data)
- **purrr** (functional programming tools)
- **tibble** (modern data frames)

## The Tidyverse Philosophy
The tidyverse promotes a consistent and intuitive approach to data analysis in R. It emphasizes:
- **Human readability**: Code is designed to be easy to read and understand.
- **Consistent syntax**: Functions across packages share similar naming conventions and arguments, reducing the learning curve.
- **Tidy data**: Data is structured in a way that makes it easy to manipulate and visualize.
- **Shared Grammar and Data Structures**: Many tidyverse packages use the same data structures (like tibbles) and share a common grammar, making it easier to switch between them.
  - **Pipes (`%>%`)**: A way to chain commands together, making code more readable.
  - **Verbs**: Functions are often named after the action they perform, such as `filter()`, `select()`, and `mutate()`, making it clear what each function does.
  - **tibbles**: A modern take on data frames that provides better printing and subsetting behavior. More predictable behavior (e.g., no automatic type conversion).

Here's a simple example of how the tidyverse philosophy is applied in practice:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>%                          # Load the mtcars dataset and pipe
  as_tibble() %>%                   # Tibble package: convert it to a tibble for better printing 
  filter(mpg > 20) %>%              # dplyr package: filter rows where mpg is greater than 20 
  mutate(kpl = mpg * 0.425144) %>%  # dplyr package: create a new column kpl (km per liter)
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = kpl)) +    # ggplot2 package: Create a ggplot using previous lines as input
  geom_point()                      # ggplot2 package: add points to the plot
```

## Installation
To use the tidyverse, you first need to install it. You can do this from CRAN using the following command:
```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To use the tidyverse, we load the main package:
```r
library(tidyverse)
```

{:.note}
>This is the basic is also the basic way to install and load packages in R. 


# Example Dataset
We will use the built-in `mtcars` dataset for demonstration:

```r
head(mtcars)
```

# Data Manipulation with `dplyr`

### Select columns
```r
mtcars %>% select(mpg, cyl, hp)
```

### Filter rows
```r
mtcars %>% filter(cyl == 6)
```

### Create new variables
```r
mtcars %>% mutate(kpl = mpg * 0.425144)
```

### Summarize data
```r
mtcars %>% summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), max_hp = max(hp))
```

### Group and summarize
```r
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), .groups = 'drop')
```

# Tidying Data with `tidyr`

### Gather (wide to long)
```r
pivot_longer(mtcars, cols = c(mpg, hp), names_to = "metric", values_to = "value") %>% head()
```

### Spread (long to wide)
```r
mtcars_long <- mtcars %>% 
  select(model = rownames(mtcars), cyl, gear) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = gear, values_from = cyl, values_fn = mean)
```

# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`

### Basic scatter plot
```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### Add trend line
```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Conclusion
The tidyverse streamlines many common data science tasks in R. It emphasizes readability and consistency, making it ideal for beginners and experienced users alike.
