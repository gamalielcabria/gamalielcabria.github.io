# GLGY699: Genomics and Bioinformatics

## ‚õèÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏èüß¨ Welcome to Genomics and Bioinformatics Course

Metagenomic data lets us look directly at all the DNA in a field sample, without needing to grow the microbes in the lab. By sequencing and analyzing that DNA, we can identify which genes are present in the community. Since genes are the ‚Äúinstruction manuals‚Äù for making enzymes and carrying out chemical reactions, this gives us a strong clue about what kinds of processes the microbes can perform.

For example, if we find genes for breaking down nitrate, we can infer that the community likely plays a role in nitrogen cycling. If we find genes linked to methane production, that suggests microbes in the sample may influence greenhouse gas release. In short, metagenomics connects the geology (what the environment supplies) and the biology (what microbes can do with it) by showing us the potential functions encoded in the microbes‚Äô DNA.

Of course, one of the big challenges is going from ‚Äúsequence‚Äù to ‚Äúfunction‚Äù ‚Äî just because a gene looks similar to one we know doesn‚Äôt always mean it works the same way in a new environment.

This course is made to help graduate-level students to understand how to tackle functional annotation of genes generated from metagenomic shotgun analyses from environmental samples. We will tackle the challenges in the validating the function of a gene or its functional protein and we will get to learn ways on how we can infer gene function from environmental datasets using bioinformatics.
