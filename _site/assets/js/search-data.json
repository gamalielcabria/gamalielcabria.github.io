Its structure often follow this structure: . | 1st: &lt;command&gt; [arguments] [options] -or- | 2nd: &lt;program&gt; &lt;command&gt; [arguments] [options] -or- | 3rd: &lt;program&gt; [arguments] [options] | . What do these terms mean: | Terminologies | Definitions | . | Program | The software to run your analysis. | . | Command | The operation within the software that needs to be performed to run your analysis | . | Arguments | Arguments are required field that indicate the user input | . | Options | Parameters that the user adds to pass on to the command to specify the detail of the run.

In the above example, it followed the first structure. The ls is a command with the argument [FILE] showing the location or path of the file/folder of interest and is shown here as /home/jovyan/. The option here is --all which reveals all file and folder hidden. Running the above code should display all files within the FILE path indicated: . $ ls /home/jovyan/ --all total 64 drwxr-xr-x 1 jovyan jovyan 4096 Sep 17 17:28 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Dec 7 2022 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 71 Dec 7 2022 apt.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 220 Apr 4 2018 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 4018 Dec 7 2022 .bashrc drwxr-xr-x 3 jovyan jovyan 4096 Sep 17 17:28 .cache drwxr-xr-x 8 jovyan jovyan 4096 Dec 7 2022 .git drwxr-xr-x 2 jovyan jovyan 4096 Sep 17 17:28 .ipython drwxr-xr-x 3 jovyan jovyan 4096 Sep 17 17:28 .jupyter -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 4908 Sep 17 17:29 .jupyter-server-log.txt drwxr-xr-x 3 jovyan jovyan 4096 Sep 17 17:28 .local -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 807 Apr 4 2018 .profile -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan 395 Dec 7 2022 README.md drwxr-xr-x 5 jovyan jovyan 4096 Dec 7 2022 unix_intro .

    "title": "Filepaths",
    "content": "When running the commands before, we only specify example.txt. This is because the example.txt is already located in our current working directory(CWD). To check our CWD, we can just look to the left of $ or subsequently try running the command: . pwd . The pwd command should display your current location: /home/jovyan/unix_intro. The filepath describes the address or location from the root/ and all the folders below it: jovyan and unix_intro. The subsequent forward slash/ after home are separator to determine the hierarchy of folders within the path. The hierarchy can be visualised as this: . / &lt;-root directory |___bin/ |___dev/ |___home/ |___jovyan/ &lt;\"~\" or the username's 'home' folder |___unix_intro &lt;-current working directory |___data/ |___example.txt |___experiment/ |___six_commands/ . The root / contains the folder bin, dev and home among others while home contains the folder jovyan which has the files. To display again all the files and folder within that location, you can run ls. There should appear the file example.txt along with all other file. ‚úÖ Notice: Running only ls shows you just the name of the file. However, try running ls -l and it should show you all the specifications of the file. This includes the accessibility of the file as indicated by drwx. The user who made the file (jovyan). The usergroup that has access to the file (jovyan). The filesize in bytes (4096/1592) and the files and folders. The folders here are displayed in blue bold fonts while individual files are in white/black font. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Not all terminals has color distinction between files and folders. Better to check ‚Äòfileszie‚Äô as all folders has attribute of 4096 . There are two types of filepath: absolute path and relative path. The absolute path is the location of the file from the root of the drive (e.g. /home/jovyan/unix_intro/example.txt) while relative path is the location of the file depending on your CWD (e.g. example.txt or ./example.txt). üìù Note: In ./example.txt the dot before the forward slash‚Äô/‚Äô indicates that it is the current directory /home/jovyan/unix_intro/. Meanwhile, ../ indicates of the path above the current workind directory. In this case, ../ indicates the folder /home/jovyan/. Therefore, we can have the same result while running the head command with the following examples: . head example.txt . head ./example.txt . `head /home/jovyan/unix_intro/example.txt . Programs and commands can often interchangeably use absolute or relative path but several scripts/programs are created to follow only absolute or relative path. Please check the programs documentation thoroughly to prevent unwanted problems. Moving paths . Unlike in GUI which you can use double-click or back button to move between folders and up and down a path, CLI needs to run a command when changing filepath or location. The primary command use to move paths is the cd or Change Directory command. The cd command is often follow by either absolute or relative path to change locations. Try running this command: . cd ../../ . This command should have move you two folders up your previous location. When you run pwd, you will see that you are in the /home folder. Now try to return to the previous working directory by running an absolute path as argument: cd /home/jovyan/unix_intro. Additionally, from this CWD, if we want to go into the subfolders/subdirectories such as experiment/, we can just run cd experiment. Subsequently, we can return to our previous workind directory by running cd -. Moving and copying files and folders . We also move files and folders using commands in CLI. To move files and folders we used the command mv. The format of this command is mv &lt;original filepath&gt; &lt;destination filepath&gt;. The filepaths can be absolute or relative. Let us try moving example.txt to inside of data/ folder: . Try running this command: . mv ./example.txt ./data/ . Run: ls ./ . And afterwards: ls ./data/ . As you can see, the example.txt did not appear now in ./ but is located in ./data/. We can use similar command when moving folders. Now, let us move back the file example.txt to its original location using mv ./data/example.txt .. The mv command can be used also to rename files and folder. You can try renaming example.txt to any other name. An example: mv example.txt example_edited.txt2. Run a ls afterward. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Renaming files to a filename that is already existing in the destination path would lead to overwriting of the file in the destination path with the file from the orginal filepath. This is a irreversible process that would lead to the loss of the destination filepath‚Äôs original content. Alternatively, you can copy file instead of moving it. When copying files and folder, run the command cp &lt;original filepath&gt; &lt;destination filepath&gt;. These command duplicates your file, so if the file has large sizes ~5-100GB, it might take a while to finish. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Copying files observed the same pitfalls are the moving command. This command can overwrite the files in the destination path too. Be very careful!!! . Making text files . Files can be created through several ways. Programs can create output files based on their output parameters. You can also create your own text files by writing in a text editor. Akin to notepad in windows, you can write text files using several programs such as vim and nano. When creating new text files in this programs, just run the commands: . nano &lt;path to folder destination&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; . vim &lt;path to folder destination&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; . An example: . nano ./data/newtextfile.txtextensioniwant . The previous example would create the text file newtextfile.txtextensioniwant inside the folder data/. If you notice, the file extension (anything beyond .) is not written as the usual .txt file extension. In most cases in a terminal, you can even drop the extension and it will still be treated as a text file. Extensions are just helpful guides for user to know what type of file or program run those file. More on this will be discuss in future lessons. üìù Note: Windows text editors often have different way of representing tabs or newlines than in MacOS and Linux OSes and can affect your program or analyses. However, they can still be open and edited in a Linux or MacOS terminal/text editor. üìù Note: Additionally, Microsoft Word files and other word processor are not recognize as text files as they are save in more elaborate file type. The two text editors are what are often installed by default in different Linux OSes. Focus on learning just one as both can be overwhelming. To learn more on how to use this text editors, click on this links: nano and vim . Vim Text Editor nano Text Editor Lastly, you can create an empty text file using the command touch &lt;filename&gt;. Making folders . For folders, creating a new one requires the command mkdir &lt;filepath&gt;. You cannot create a new folder that already exists. The command will output a warning prompt. You can create multiple folders in a single command with multiple input arguments. When running the command, separating the folder names with spaces as shown: . mkdir test test1 test2 test3 . Removing files and folders . To remove files, use the command rm. For folders with items in it, the command often will prompt you that it cannot remove a folder as it is a directory. You can run rm -r or the recursive option to delete the folder and all subsequent files inside it. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Running this command will permanently delete your files. There is no trash bin to recover your files. So be very paranoid when removing files in important folders. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: You can delete other people‚Äôs file in a shared environment even if you do not have a permission to access those files. So be very careful and do not delete other people‚Äôs files. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Again be very attentive in which files you are deleting. It would be better to delete files individually than in a batch, like deleting a whole folder. ",
