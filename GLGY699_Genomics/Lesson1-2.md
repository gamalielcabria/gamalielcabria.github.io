# What are Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetic trees serve as vital tools in biology, providing a structured visual representation of the evolutionary relationships among various biological entities, including species, genes, and viruses. These trees are grounded in the principles of common ancestry and depict how different organisms or genes have diverged from shared ancestors over time (Bordewich et al., 2017; Gregory, 2008). They are constructed using various forms of data, primarily genetic sequences such as DNA, RNA, or protein alignments, which allows for detailed comparative analyses (McMahon et al., 2015).

Given that phylogenetic trees shows evolutionary relations, aligning DNA, RNA and/or protein sequences is a must step to properly score for any changes in the sequence, may it be substitution, deletion, insertion and/or duplication.

## Exercise 2A: Building a Tree
Here, we will use the multiple sequence alignments created from previous exercise. We will use the fasta formatted MSA files.
